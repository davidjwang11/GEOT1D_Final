Real income per taxpayer (RIPT) is the aggregate real taxable income (ARTI) divided by the number of taxable individuals (NTI) in a region. RIPT is an indicator of individual economic wellbeing - that is, how much on average an individual taxpayer of a region receives. Note here that RIPT is only an indicator of the average income of regional residents. People who did not submit a tax return or those who had taxable incomes below the income threshold are not included and so RIPT is likely to overestimate the actual average income of regional residents. As the indicator is not dependent on the region?s population size, it can be used to compare incomes across regions, as well as over time.
